Passionate software developer with over a decade of experience since 2010. My goal is to create innovative technological solutions that have a positive impact on people's lives.

Throughout my career, I have collaborated with international teams on large-scale projects, playing key roles in web development. My versatility is not only limited to the web realm but also encompasses mobile and desktop applications. My self-taught approach constantly drives me to explore new technologies, and I'm particularly excited about the world of Artificial Intelligence.
